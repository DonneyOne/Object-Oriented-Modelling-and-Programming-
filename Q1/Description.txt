The program asks for input of the user, which could either be "c" for a card game or "d" for die game identifying, which of two games the user wants to play.
The user's input is being checked for validity and then he/she proceeds into the game chosen.
There is a die game and a card game defined in the main Game class. The card game has the rules of defined 52 normal cards. The user gets 2 random cards.
If the card that the user has gotten is Ace non-the-less of the suit of the ace, he/she wins. If not he/she loses.
The other game defined is a die game, where the user would win only if he/she rolls one, otherwise, he/she loses.
Both the games are completely random since there is a generator with a defined interface that would generate a random number with a specific seed that would be crucial
in both card choosing and die rolling methods/processes. Functionally the two games share methods as they both have: Initialise game, main game and declare game winner.
That is why the class of Game could be implemented as interface and the two games as classes that implement the Game interface.
